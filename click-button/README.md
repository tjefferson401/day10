# Click Button
In this assignment, you will use Selenium to click the "+" button 10 times on this website:
https://www.rapidtables.com/tools/click-counter.html

To find out what data to scrape, click through the html of our site. Remember, you can go right to the html of specific elements, by right clicking on the element and selecting "Inspect".

Recall that ChatGPT can be a helpful resource in troubleshooting issues with Selenium.

### Hints
Remember, you can find an element by its ID using `find_element(By.ID, "<id>")`.
You can use the `element.click()` method to click an element.

#### SUPER HINT
look for the ID "addbtn" in the site's HTML. This is the ID of the button you need to click.
